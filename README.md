## Introduction

What is statechart? Simple put:

- It's a statemachine.
- Supports hierarchy.
- With various state mode.

This plugin provides basic nodes to build statechart in Godot editor.

## Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Before you start:
>
> 1. You need .NET-enabled version of Godot.
> 2. Download repository.
> 3. Copy `addons/statechart_sharp` to your project folder.
> 4. Build project once.
> 5. Enable plugin in project setting.

**Step 1** : Add <img src="./addons/statechart_sharp/icon/Statechart.svg" alt="Statechart" style="width:16px;" align="bottom"/> Statechart node

**Step 2** : Add <img src="./addons/statechart_sharp/icon/State.svg" style="width:16px;" alt="State" align="bottom"/> State node

- A root state, as child of a statechart.
- Add substates under root state.
- Switch state mode: compound, parallel, or history.
- Connect signals.

**Step 3** : Add <img src="./addons/statechart_sharp/icon/Transition.svg" style="width:16px;" alt="Transition" align="bottom"/> Transition node

- As child of a state: where we exit from.
- Assign target states: where we enter to.
- Switch transition event: node loop event, custom event, or auto.
- Connect signals.

**Step 4** : Add <img src="./addons/statechart_sharp/icon/Reaction.svg" style="width:16px;" alt="Action" align="bottom"/> Reaction node

- As child of a state.
- Switch reaction event: node loop event, or custom event.
- Connect signals.

**Step 5** : Build and run

- Statechart will step node loop events through states, as long as it is not disabled or paused.
- To step a custom event, call `Statechart.Step(StringName)` .

## Specification

To get full perspective on statechart, you may refer to:

- https://statecharts.dev/ for conceptual introduction.
- https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/ for detailed specification.

### Statechart <img src="./addons/statechart_sharp/icon/Statechart.svg" alt="Statechart" style="width:16px;" align="bottom"/>

The control node of whole statechart. You can simply take it as "state machine node" as in common state machine system. To make it work properly, add exactly 1 child `State` node as `RootState` , which is always active.

At the very beginning, statechart initializes itself, then root state, and all the state, transition, and reaction nodes appended to it. All the composition will be indexed with "document order" â€” the order they showed in an expanded node tree, which is followed by most iteration process.

Statechart provides `Step` method, which is the sole way we interact with statechart. To be specific, node loop event also calls `Step` method, the only difference is that they use built-in event string, defined in `util/StatechartConfig.cs` .

During the `Step` method, statechart will do following things:

1. Queue event, if statechart is already running a step. If not the case, statechart will fetch event from queue, and continues following tasks.
2. With fetched event, statechart select transitions from active states.
3. Execute selected transitions.
4. Select and execute auto transitions from active states, do several rounds.
5. With fetched event, statechart invoke reactions from active states.
6. If event queue is not cleared, fetch another event from queue, back to 2.

Here's several specification you shall follow:

- Do not manually call `Step` with node loop event, especially when a step is running.
- Do not call same event from a running step, this may cause unintended endless loop.

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `int MaxAutoTransitionRound` | Max iteration rounds of selecting auto transitions in a single step. If `MaxAutoTransitionRound<=0` , statechart will ignore any auto transition. |

| Method | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `void Step(StringName)` | Make statechart run a step with given event. |


### State

This node works as "state" as in common state machine system, but can be arranged in a tree structure, as hierarchical state machine do.

Beware, only a collection of states in the tree are active. Root state is no doubt always active. For the rest, they largely depend on their parent's "state mode": `Compound`, `Parallel`, or `History`. State mode determines how state deal with child state (also called substate), and other behaviors when traversing state tree.

`Compound` is the default mode of a state:

- If it is active, then exactly 1 substate will be active (if there's any, except history state), which is called current state.
- Initial state is the substate a compound will choose as current state by default. You can assign it in inspector, or the first substate will be initial state (if there's any, except history state).

`Parallel` is kinda opposite to compund:

- If it is active, then all substate will be active (except history state).

`History` is a special mode only used as transition target. It will redirect to the sibling(s) once active till last exit of parent state.

- Never active.
- You can switch whether a history state is deep or not.

  - A shallow history only recovers parent's status, leaves default entry to descendants.
  - A deep history recovers parent's status as well as descendants', leaves no default entry.

- For the state never been active before, history equals to default entry, no matter deep or not.

Here's several specification you shall follow:

- Do not append substate to history: state, transition, reaction won't function as history's child. However, you may occasionally assign a history's substate as transition target, which may cause unexpected behavior.
- Better not use shallow history to a parallel state. It equals to set the parallel as target.

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `enum StateModeEnum StateMode` | Enumeration of state mode. |
| `bool IsDeepHistory` | Used in history mode only. |
| `State InitialState` | The substate that will be choosed as current state by default. If not assigned, first substate will be initial state (if there's any). Used in compound mode only. |

### Transition

### Reaction

## Todo

Statechart:

- add save/load
- loop event flags

Example:

- test scene
- practical usage
