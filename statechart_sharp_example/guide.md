# Statechart Example Guidance

- build with script: use code to build statchart node tree.
- disconnect: proper way to connect signals with code if you want auto-disconnect in csharp.
- extensive: impl behavior by deriving instead of using signals.
- immersive_controller: fps controller with many motion states.
- save&load: save and load statechart status with serializable StatechartSnapshot.
- start: demo scene where I took screenshoot for README.
- test: test and showcase for detailed statechart behavior.
